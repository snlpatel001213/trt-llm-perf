 Nvidia excel sheet has following columns 

ISL, OSL, #Requests, Concurrency, #GPUs, num_samples, num_error_samples, total_latency(ms), seq_throughput(seq/sec), token_throughput(token/sec), avg_sequence_latency(ms), max_sequence_latency(ms), min_sequence_latency(ms), p99_sequence_latency(ms), p90_sequence_latency(ms), p50_sequence_latency(ms), avg_time_to_first_token(ms), max_time_to_first_token(ms), min_time_to_first_token(ms), p99_time_to_first_token(ms), p90_time_to_first_token(ms), p50_time_to_first_token(ms), avg_inter_token_latency(ms), max_inter_token_latency(ms), min_inter_token_latency(ms), p99_inter_token_latency(ms), p90_inter_token_latency(ms), p50_inter_token_latency(ms), util_min, util_max, util_avg, mem_min, mem_max, mem_avg

Dell excel sheet has following column 
No. H200 GPU on single server, Active Parameters (BN), Active Parameters per GPU (BN), Input Length, Output Length, Batch size, Successful requests, Input tokens, Output tokens generated, Prefill Latency (ms), Total Latency (sec), Input token throughput (tok/sec), Output token throughput (tok/sec), Total token throughput (tok/sec), TPOT (ms), ITL (ms), Total Latency (ms), Decode latency (ms), Output token throughput per GPU (tokens/sec), Expected Prefill latency (ms), Expected TPOT (ms), Estimated Max throughput tokens/s, Total throughput, Calculated Compute Utilization, Prefill TFLOPS, Decode TFLOPS, Efficiency Prefill, Memory Bandwidth Efficiency Decode, Prefill FLOPS Utilization, Decode FLOPS Utilization, Overall FLOPS Utilization


In both the excel sheet (Nvidia and Dell Respectively) following rows means the same. 
token_throughput(token/sec) = 
avg_time_to_first_token(ms) = 
ISL == Input Length
OSL == Output Length
Concurrency == Batch size
util_avg == Calculated Compute Utilization
